# @atmo-dev/contrail

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- e050b0b: Add verified Lexicon-prefix initialization with CID-pinned dependency bundles, automatic safe query fields, and optional reference/relation prompts.

## 0.22.1

### Patch Changes

- 825aa85: Keep optional CPU telemetry and Jetstream v2 cursor preflights compatible with Cloudflare Workers. Exposed but unimplemented `process.cpuUsage` methods now degrade to `null`, and cursor probes use a receiver-safe fetch call with fail-closed manual redirect handling.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- b851583: Switch scheduled and persistent live ingestion to Jetstream v2 using the official `@bsky/jetstream` client. Live cursors now use instance-local sequence numbers, one normalized v2 service is durably pinned to each generation, legacy timestamp cursors transition atomically into the seq domain, and existing PDS/Alluvium historical acquisition remains unchanged. Alluvium bootstrap now has a separate `sourceUrl`/`--alluvium-source-url` for its legacy v1 manifest identity. Unscoped `getCursor` responses now return `{ cursor }`; ordered-source responses retain their opaque `{ source, epoch, cursor }` position. The minimum supported Node.js version is now 22.15.

### Patch Changes

- 28f94c9: Allow config-backed `contrail dev` and `contrail connect` to continue after confirmation when configured Lexicons cannot yet be resolved, omitting incomplete schema closures and generating untyped values for affected records.

## 0.21.2

### Patch Changes

- 60e7b3a: Run Atcute's Lexicon CLI with an explicit module redirect for its byte-array helper so `contrail dev` works with pnpm's strictly isolated global package links.

## 0.21.1

### Patch Changes

- de3f48a: Declare the byte-array helper used by Atcute's Lexicon CLI so `contrail dev` can resolve Lexicons in isolated `pnpx` installs.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 2202c5e: Add `contrail init [directory]` to create a ready-to-run starter `contrail.config.ts` without overwriting an existing config.

## 0.20.1

### Patch Changes

- 92fedb0: Bound scheduled Jetstream cycles by retained candidate count, distinct identity updates, and serialized bytes; batch identity writes; drop exact transport observations before admission; preserve same-timestamp observations and durable actor scope across capped restarts; capture empty initial cursors safely; reject rollback-prone endpoint pools in scheduled mode; and emit one bounded aggregate cycle summary.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- bc2f4c1: Add the first transactional projection change-log milestone. Optional static consumer definitions now create a fresh-generation log, durable registrations, and collection/phase coverage ledger. Winning logical URI changes append compact references atomically with canonical records, derived projections, tombstones, and source checkpoints; disabled configurations create no log tables or append writes.

  Harden all projection writers with transaction-time predecessor guards and bounded conflict retries so overlapping cron, persistent, notify, and backfill work cannot commit stale canonical or derived state. Add independent bounded consumer leases, filtered/coalesced claims, set-oriented current-state hydration, CAS acknowledgement, failure backoff, lease renewal, private status, and manual retry APIs. Add crash-safe current-state snapshot/tail/activation bootstrap, safe additive consumers over existing coverage, required-consumer readiness gates, consumer-aware bounded pruning, and audited explicit skip operations. Current-state consumers require both projection phases, and candidate destination tokens are scoped strictly to bootstrap deliveries. Private `contrail changes` commands cover status, retry, prune, and skip. Add fair bounded Worker delivery after ingestion/retries, best-effort immediate notify wakes, runtime handler validation, deadline cancellation, isolated retry scheduling, and a persistent delivery supervisor. Include an app-owned atmo.rsvp Meilisearch reference consumer with task-success acknowledgement, hidden/delete convergence, candidate-index snapshot/tail bootstrap, and idempotent generation-marker activation. Enabling or expanding log coverage on a populated generation fails closed pending explicit quiet-boundary migration tooling.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 2e01ffe: Correct service auth to use an exact fragmented DID service audience and deterministic least-privilege OAuth RPC scope. Discovery, provider locks, generated clients, and DID documents now distinguish the base service DID from the JWT audience and pin the protected method set. Existing consumers must reconnect, regenerate, and reauthorize; old plain-DID/wildcard OAuth grants are not compatible.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 4b420c6: Remove whole-service contract digests with clean version-2 service manifests and provider locks. Anonymous generated clients now call providers without a discovery preflight, while content-addressed Lexicon verification and service-auth discovery remain. `contrail connect` now accepts owned config files or directories to generate a local typed API without changing the deployment lock, generated clients expose local/target factories, and `contrail dev` no longer writes consumer connection artifacts.

## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- 0039ab2: Replace SQLite and D1 full-text-search URI scans with an ordinary unique URI-to-rowid mapping and direct FTS5 rowid mutations. Existing URI-bearing FTS tables are rebuilt transactionally from canonical records, stale-fingerprint projections are rebuilt and verified before acceptance, duplicate search rows are removed, and incremental/rebuild whitespace normalization now agrees. PostgreSQL search remains unchanged.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- a5ebbba: Add an optional experimental Alluvium fresh-generation adapter plus D1 and SQLite `contrail backfill --alluvium` workflows. Add a zero-configuration SQLite `contrail dev` service with automatic Lexicon resolution, backfill, bounded live ingestion, localhost public-service discovery, stable local consumer lock/type/client generation, and loopback-only open notify without fictitious service auth. Add per-collection `validate: true`, bound to the exact generated runtime bundle with shared CID/strictness knobs; omitted or false collections remain unvalidated. Auto-added profile/follow collections no longer create generic public methods. The Alluvium adapter pins compatible version-1 collection manifests, verifies immutable gzip objects before projection, resumes multipart bases, replays archived puts/deletes, and atomically seeds the normal live cursor at the archive boundary under an operator-owned continuity epoch.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 9baa877: Add discoverable AT Protocol service authentication, unified authenticated clients for PDS and provider methods, and automatic authoritative update notifications after tracked record writes.
- 6d6c750: Restore deterministic query-Lexicon generation from Contrail config, add drift checking, and orchestrate source pulling and TypeScript generation through Atcute.
- aad30e2: Add self-describing anonymous read-through services with verified contracts, durable ordered-source positions, cacheable Lexicon discovery, and a safe `contrail connect` workflow for typed independent clients.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- e5a3e49: Add source-neutral snapshot and ordered-change contracts, capture-first bootstrap orchestration, and a database-backed target that commits projection progress atomically for fresh generations. Persist source continuity epochs and the capture mark before snapshot preparation. Add resumable, host-aware relay/PDS snapshots plus source-confirmed Jetstream marks, bounded ordered replay, retention-expiry detection, required source-semantics gates, durable bounded failure categories, aggregate candidate verification, and an immutable deployment-tuple registry with compare-and-swap activation and rollback retention.

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- 2826860: Remove the best-effort post-commit sink API. Contrail now limits core ingestion to transactional SQL projection instead of invoking external callbacks after live or historical commits.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 0b36208: Add opt-in strict runtime Lexicon validation and canonical DAG-CBOR CID verification to the shared ingestion path. Route profile enrichment and Constellation follows through the same admission, source-ordering, projection, and sink behavior; expose bounded aggregate rejection diagnostics; and keep bulk backfill efficient by prefiltering out-of-scope dependencies, treating successful PDS pages as authoritative observations, and flushing diagnostics once per run.

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- b4a0125: Add durable source ordering metadata and tombstones so stale creates, updates, and deletes cannot replace newer state. Commit live Jetstream cursors atomically with projection, checkpoint only yielded events, preserve failed persistent batches, separate record time from source time, migrate existing rows to version metadata, and update supported dependencies.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c5cea6: Collapse Contrail into one public package and one AppView implementation. Remove the spaces, authority, record-host, community, realtime, sync, and custom Lexicon-tooling products. Route Jetstream, persistent, backfill, and immediate synchronization records through the shared `ingestRecords` admission and projection path. Make materialized relation counts converge when children arrive before parents, and prevent transient PDS failures from being interpreted as authoritative deletions. Keep dependent-subject filtering scoped to dependent collections and restore typed example XRPC clients with Atcute's generator. Preserve `node:sqlite` in the published adapter, make all query and search cursors stable across tied and typed/null rows, use Worker-safe cursor encoding, and bound the complete notify resolution/fetch/body operation. Admit newly discovered actors and their dependent mutations as one batch, and keep subject decisions mutation-local so deletes always pass. Existing pagination cursors from 0.12 are intentionally invalidated by the new stable cursor format; clients should discard persisted cursor tokens when upgrading. Local development now launches Wrangler through the workspace's pnpm installation instead of invoking `npx`.
- a8a2b45: Remove the incomplete `refresh` PDS sweep from the public API, CLI, Wrangler helpers, examples, and documentation. Normal ingestion resumes from its saved source cursor; deployments whose source history has expired should rebuild into a fresh database rather than rely on partial reconciliation that cannot safely infer deletions.

### Patch Changes

- ad9557c: Keep failed PDS and relay work pending with bounded retries instead of marking account rows complete. Retry due PDS accounts automatically in small scheduled slices with persisted exponential backoff up to 48 hours, a ten-scheduled-attempt limit, and an overlap lease. Add durable backfill and discovery state to the JSON overview and `/status` endpoint, including running/complete state, retry timing, per-collection progress, and mutually exclusive complete/pending/retrying/failed account counts.
- c74aec5: Group historical fetches by PDS with bounded per-host concurrency, stream resolved identities directly into host workers, cancel timed-out requests, defer failed initial accounts to scheduled retries, atomically commit canonical pages with cursor checkpoints, and rebuild FTS and relation counts with set-based SQL after canonical bulk loading. SQLite batches now use synchronous transactions so concurrent backfill work cannot overlap or partially commit.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- bea0dd2: A third community-creation mode: **provision**. alongside the existing `adopt` (caller already has a `did:plc`) and `mint` (caller wants a DID but brings their own PDS) modes, contrail can now provision a community on a stock `@atproto/pds` end-to-end — minting the `did:plc`, creating and activating the PDS account, generating an app password, and persisting credentials so the existing `community.putRecord` / `.deleteRecord` publish path keeps working. contrail never holds PDS admin credentials.

  **`xrpc/{ns}.community.provision`** runs the five-step PLC + PDS dance (key generation → PLC genesis → `createAccount` → `getRecommendedDidCredentials` + signed PLC update op → `activateAccount`), persists each step in a new `provision_attempts` table so a partially-failed attempt can be resumed, mints an app password, and seeds the session cache.

  **`contrail-community reap [--all-stuck] [--older-than <minutes>] [--db <url>] [--dry-run]`** new CLI (a bin shipped by `@atmo-dev/contrail-community`) that cleans up provision attempts which didn't reach `status='activated'` by tombstoning their PLC entries. `--dry-run` is the default; per-row confirmation is required for live reaping unless `--all-stuck` is given. `--all-stuck` only acts on rows idle at least `--older-than` minutes (default 30) so a bulk run can't tombstone an in-flight provision. Runs against the Cloudflare D1 binding by default, or against the decoupled Postgres index when `--db`/`DATABASE_URL` is set. It ships as a contrail-community bin because the PR #30 package split removed contrail's edge into community code: under pnpm's isolated `node_modules` the core `contrail` CLI can't resolve `@atmo-dev/contrail-community`, so `contrail reap` only registers in hoisted installs where both packages sit together.

  custody model: the caller supplies a `rotationKey` and that key sits at `rotationKeys[0]` — the highest-priority rotation slot on the resulting DID. contrail generates a subordinate keypair and persists it (AES-GCM-encrypted under `masterKey`) at `rotationKeys[1]`, so it can submit later PLC ops on the community's behalf — most importantly the post-activation PLC update during provision, and the tombstone op that `reap` issues to clean up stuck DIDs.

  the caller's key dominates: PLC's 72-hour nullification window means any op contrail signs with its subordinate key can be overridden within 72h by an op signed with the caller's key. with this caveat: a tombstone is irrevocable. a malicious or compromised contrail instance could tombstone any DID it provisioned. there is no managed code path, no shared rotation, and `rootCredentials` are returned to the caller in the response so they can also be persisted out-of-band.

  what you need to configure / know:

  - new `community` config block: `masterKey` (32-byte AES-GCM envelope key for the encrypted credential columns), `allowedProvisionPdsEndpoints` (URL-origin matching, collapses scheme case / default ports / trailing slash / IDN), optional `plcDirectory` override.

  - **provisioning fails closed.** When `allowProvisioning` is true, `allowedProvisionPdsEndpoints` MUST be non-empty — a missing/empty allowlist no longer means "accept any PDS" (that was a fail-open hole: any caller could have a PLC genesis op signed by Contrail's rotation key against an attacker-chosen PDS). To deliberately accept any endpoint, set the separate, loud `allowAnyProvisionPdsEndpoint: true`. The field was renamed from `allowedPdsEndpoints` to make clear it gates _provisioning_ only, not which PDSes Contrail reads/indexes.

  - new tables `provision_attempts` and `community_credentials`. credentials are stored AES-GCM-encrypted under that key; lose the key, lose the ability to mint sessions for previously-provisioned communities.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 7e3145b: Spaces refactor: split authority + record host into independently runnable
  roles, add space credentials, extract community into its own package.

  **Breaking — config shape**

  `spaces` is no longer flat — split into `authority` and `recordHost`:

  ```ts
  // before
  spaces: {
    type: "com.example.event.space",
    serviceDid: "did:web:example.com",
    blobs: { adapter, maxSize },
  }

  // after
  spaces: {
    authority: {
      type: "com.example.event.space",
      serviceDid: "did:web:example.com",
      signing: await generateAuthoritySigningKey(),
    },
    recordHost: {
      blobs: { adapter, maxSize },
    },
  }
  ```

  **Breaking — community moved to its own package**

  Community has been extracted to `@atmo-dev/contrail-community`. Wire it via
  `createCommunityIntegration`:

  ```ts
  import { Contrail, resolveConfig } from "@atmo-dev/contrail";
  import { createCommunityIntegration } from "@atmo-dev/contrail-community";

  const resolved = resolveConfig(config);
  const communityIntegration = createCommunityIntegration({
    db,
    config: resolved,
  });
  const contrail = new Contrail({ ...config, communityIntegration });
  ```

  The community config (`config.community`) stays the same; only the wiring
  moves. Imports of `CommunityAdapter`, `registerCommunityRoutes`,
  `reconcile`, etc. now come from `@atmo-dev/contrail-community` instead of
  `@atmo-dev/contrail`.

  **New — space credentials (`X-Space-Credential`)**

  The space authority issues short-lived ES256 JWTs (default 2h TTL) via
  `<ns>.space.getCredential` and `refreshCredential`. The record host accepts
  them on read/write paths in lieu of per-request service-auth JWTs. Skips
  DID-doc fetches and member checks; the credential's signature is the proof.

  Generate a signing key once at deploy time:

  ```ts
  import { generateAuthoritySigningKey } from "@atmo-dev/contrail";
  const signing = await generateAuthoritySigningKey();
  // Store the JWK; pass to spaces.authority.signing.
  ```

  **New — binding resolution**

  Verifiers can resolve "which authority signs for this space?" from three
  sources, in order: local enrollment table, PDS records at
  `at://<owner>/<type>/<key>`, DID-doc `#atproto_space_authority` service
  entry, owner-self fallback. Lets user-owned DIDs authorize a third-party
  authority via a normal PDS write — no DID-doc surgery.

  **New — independent deployments + enrollment**

  The authority and record host can run as separate processes/operators.
  A new `<ns>.recordHost.enroll` endpoint lets owners (or authorities)
  register a space onto a host. In-process deployments auto-enroll on
  `createSpace`; nothing changes for single-instance setups.

  See `docs/10-deployment-shapes.md` for all-in-one / authority-only /
  host-only configurations and when to choose each.

  **Migration**

  For most deployments running spaces today, the migration is:

  1. Update the config: split `spaces.{type, serviceDid, blobs}` into
     `spaces.authority.{type, serviceDid}` and `spaces.recordHost.{blobs}`.
  2. Generate and store an authority signing key
     (`generateAuthoritySigningKey()`); add to `spaces.authority.signing`.
  3. If using community: install `@atmo-dev/contrail-community`, build
     `createCommunityIntegration({ db, config })`, pass via
     `new Contrail({ communityIntegration })` (or `createApp({ community })`).

  Existing service-auth JWT clients keep working as a fallback path.
  Migrate to space credentials when convenient — exchange a JWT for a
  credential once via `getCredential`, then reuse it.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- af24714: Add per-collection `recordFilter` and apply Jetstream `#identity` handle changes during ingest.
  - `CollectionConfig.recordFilter?: (record) => boolean` runs against each create/update during ingest; returning false drops the record before it reaches the DB. Useful for narrowing high-volume collections to just the records you care about (e.g. only `app.bsky.feed.post` records mentioning a particular URL). Deletes are not filtered, so they still tear down any record the filter previously let through. Throws are caught, logged, and treated as drops.
  - Jetstream `#identity` events (handle changes) now flow through to the `identities` table via a new `applyIdentityEvent` helper. UPDATE-only — unknown DIDs are no-ops so we don't materialize partial rows lacking PDS.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 1a6d8cf: Follow-feed overhaul. Several related changes that together fix correctness and storage problems with how follow-driven feeds are bootstrapped, ingested, and recovered.

  **Backfill correctness — `time_us` now reflects record `createdAt`.** Backfilled records previously had `time_us` set to ingest time, which silently broke any time-ordered query and made `feed_items` snapshots taken right after a backfill useless. The canonical time is parsed from the record's `createdAt` (clamped to now to defuse user-supplied future timestamps) and used as `time_us`. Per-collection override via the new `CollectionConfig.timeField` (set to `false` to keep ingest time, e.g. for collections without a time field).

  **`feed_backfills.completed` no longer falsely marks success.** The wrapper used to mark `completed = 1` even when the underlying follow walk timed out or returned zero, locking users into a permanently empty feed. The flag now flips only after `backfills.completed = 1` is observed for the follow collection. New `retries`, `last_error`, and `started_at` columns mirror the existing `backfills` schema and let stuck rows be re-armed after `BACKFILL_STALE_MS`.

  **Feed bootstrap moved out of the request path.** `getFeed` no longer blocks on a synchronous PDS walk. Instead it claims the `feed_backfills` row and schedules `runFeedBackfill` via `c.executionCtx.waitUntil` (Cloudflare Workers) or fire-and-forget on Node/Bun. First request returns whatever `feed_items` already has; subsequent requests reflect the full backfill once it lands. Live fanout (which adds a new follow's last 100 posts on the spot) makes the empty first response uncommon in practice for already-active users.

  **Per-target item caps.** `FeedConfig.targets` now accepts `string | { collection, maxItems? }`, and pruning partitions by `(actor, collection)` so a high-volume target (e.g. RSVPs) can't squeeze a low-volume one (e.g. events) out of the cap. `pruneFeedItems` accepts either a global cap (legacy) or `Map<collection-NSID, cap>`; jetstream/persistent ingest cycles now compute the per-collection map via `buildFeedTargetCaps`.

  **Subject filter for follow ingest + backfill.** New `CollectionConfig.subjectField` — when set, ingest drops records whose subject DID isn't already in `identities`. For a typical bsky user with 2k follows but only 10 pointing at known DIDs, this trims storage by ~200x. Applied identically in live jetstream filtering and per-page during backfill.

  **`app.bsky.*` defaults to `discover: false`.** Any collection whose NSID lives under `app.bsky.*` and doesn't explicitly set `discover` is treated as dependent — preventing a footgun where forgetting `discover: false` on `app.bsky.graph.follow` would persist every follow on the network.

  **Auto-add follow collection.** `FeedConfig.follow` is now optional and defaults to `"follow"` (auto-added with NSID `app.bsky.graph.follow`, `discover: false`, and `subjectField: "subject"`) when no feed declares it. `feeds: { home: { targets: ["post"] } }` now produces correct behavior with no explicit follow plumbing.

  **Constellation reverse-lookup (opt-out, default on).** When a DID first appears in `identities` via a discoverable event, contrail queries [Constellation](https://constellation.microcosm.blue/) for follow records pointing at that DID and ingests synthesized rows for any follower already in `identities`. Lets newcomers immediately surface in existing users' feeds without per-follower PDS walks. Disable with `constellation: false` or `constellation: { enabled: false }`. Sends `User-Agent: contrail/<namespace>` per Constellation's request that callers identify themselves.

  **Wire-level `collection` param accepts NSIDs.** `getFeed` now matches the generated lexicon enum: the `collection` parameter is interpreted as a full NSID and translated to the short name internally. Short names are still tolerated for backwards compatibility.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 8513b3e: small fixes

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 0e6ba77: update cli

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 469bf65: unify the per-space marker field on records as `space` everywhere. previously `listRecords` / `getRecord` HTTP responses used `space: <spaceUri>` while watch events and `WatchRecord` exposed it as `_space`. the underscored form was inconsistent with the surrounding fields (`uri`, `cid`, `did`, etc.) and forced consumers to remember which path produced which name.

  **breaking.** anywhere you read `r._space` on a `WatchRecord` (or a watch event payload's `record._space` / `child._space`), rename to `r.space`. drop-in.

  ```ts
  // before
  if (record._space) ...

  // after
  if (record.space) ...
  ```

  no migration needed for `listRecords` / `getRecord` consumers — that path was already `space`.

- 469bf65: permissioned spaces now use the `ats://` scheme instead of `at://`. tracks the [permissioned data spec](https://dholms.leaflet.pub/3mhj6bcqats2o), which floats `ats://` as a distinct scheme so spaces can't be confused with atproto record URIs at any layer (logs, query params, dispatch, error messages).

  ```
  - at://did:plc:alice/com.example.event.space/birthday
  + ats://did:plc:alice/com.example.event.space/birthday
  ```

  what changed:

  - `buildSpaceUri` / `parseSpaceUri` (`@atmo-dev/contrail`) emit / accept `ats://`. anything else returns `null` from `parseSpaceUri`.
  - generated lexicons no longer claim `format: "at-uri"` on `spaceUri` params, on the `space` record-output field, or on `spaceView.uri` — they're plain `string`. (atproto's `at-uri` format would reject `ats://`.) regenerate committed `lexicons/generated/*` with `contrail-lex generate`; downstream `lex-cli generate` then emits `v.string()` instead of `v.resourceUriString()` for those fields.
  - realtime topics are unchanged in shape (`space:<uri>`), but `<uri>` is now an `ats://` URI.
  - record URIs (the `uri` on a record, the `appPolicyRef` field, `notifyOfUpdate` payloads) keep `at://` — those are still atproto record URIs.

  **breaking.** anywhere you build a space URI by string concatenation (`` `at://${did}/${type}/${key}` ``), switch to `ats://` or call `buildSpaceUri()`. anywhere you persist space URIs in your own DB, migrate (`UPDATE … SET space_uri = REPLACE(space_uri, 'at://', 'ats://') WHERE space_uri LIKE 'at://%'`).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f8fa672: align the `listRecords` / `getRecord` response envelope with atproto's `com.atproto.repo.*`. the field that carries the record value is now `value`, not `record`.

  **before** (contrail-specific):

  ```jsonc
  { "records": [{ "uri", "did", "collection", "rkey", "cid", "record": {...}, "time_us" }] }
  ```

  **after** (atproto-compatible plus extras):

  ```jsonc
  { "records": [{ "uri", "cid", "value": {...}, "did", "collection", "rkey", "time_us" }] }
  ```

  changes:

  - `#record` def now requires `["uri", "cid", "value"]` (matches atproto's standard `com.atproto.repo.listRecords#record`). `did`/`collection`/`rkey`/`time_us` remain in the response but are optional.
  - `getRecord` top-level output requires `["uri", "value"]` (matches atproto's `com.atproto.repo.getRecord`).
  - profile entries in `?profiles=true` responses use `value` instead of `record` for the profile record body.
  - realtime watch events (`record.created`, `snapshot.record`, `hydration.added`) — the inner record payload's body field is now `value`.
  - `@atmo-dev/contrail-sync`: `WatchRecord.value` (was `record`); `addOptimistic({ value })` (was `record`).

  **breaking.** anywhere you read `r.record` from a contrail response, rename to `r.value`. anywhere you call `addOptimistic({ record: ... })`, switch to `addOptimistic({ value: ... })`. regenerate committed `lexicons/generated/*` in each deployment — the new shape will be advertised on next `contrail-lex generate` run.

- b81038c: rename `contrail.sync()` → `contrail.backfillAll()` and emit progress via `config.logger` by default.

  the method previously returned `{ discovered, backfilled }` but emitted no output, so callers had to wire up their own `onProgress`. it now logs discovery + throttled backfill progress + final summary through `config.logger` (defaults to `console`). supplying `onProgress` still takes over, and passing a no-op logger silences it.

  also renames the internal `backfillAll` function (in `src/core/backfill.ts`) to `backfillPending` to reduce confusion with the new public method. not publicly exported, so no user-facing impact.

  adds a `contrail` CLI bin with a `backfill` subcommand so workers deploys don't need a local script file at all:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "backfill":        "contrail backfill --config src/config.ts",
    "backfill:remote": "contrail backfill --config src/config.ts --remote"
  }
  ```

  auto-detects `contrail.config.ts`, `app/config.ts`, or `src/lib/contrail/config.ts`; loads TS configs via `jiti` (no tsx hook required). flags: `--config`, `--remote`, `--binding <name>`, `--concurrency <n>`.

  the underlying helper is also exported at `@atmo-dev/contrail/workers` for embedded use:

  ```ts
  import { backfillAll } from "@atmo-dev/contrail/workers";
  await backfillAll({ config, remote: true });
  ```

  `wrangler` is an optional peer dep — only imported at runtime when the cli/helper is called.

  breaking: `contrail.sync()` is gone; rename callsites to `contrail.backfillAll()`. signature and return shape unchanged.

- ad3a61d: add `contrail dev` — local dev wrapper for cloudflare workers deployments.

  replaces `wrangler dev --test-scheduled` + a separate cron-trigger script with one command. on start it:

  1. connects to your local D1 via wrangler's `getPlatformProxy`, inspects state
  2. prompts to run `backfillAll` if no completed backfills exist yet
  3. prompts to run `refresh` if the ingest cursor is older than 60 minutes (configurable with `--stale-after`)
  4. spawns `wrangler dev --test-scheduled`
  5. fires `GET /__scheduled?cron=...` every 60 seconds so the cron actually runs in local dev (wrangler's scheduler only works in deployed production)

  flags: `--cron <expr>` (default `"*/1 * * * *"`), `--stale-after <min>` (default 60), `--yes` to auto-accept prompts, plus the standard `--config` / `--root` / `--binding`.

  prompts are skipped in non-TTY environments (default-declined).

  also adds `--yes` to the CLI-wide arg parser.

- ad3063a: two new DX pieces:

  **`@atmo-dev/contrail/worker`** exports `createWorker(config, options?)` — a prebuilt Cloudflare Workers entry that collapses the ~12-line `{ fetch, scheduled }` boilerplate to one line:

  ```ts
  import { createWorker } from "@atmo-dev/contrail/worker";
  import { config } from "./contrail.config";
  import { lexicons } from "../lexicons/generated";

  export default createWorker(config, { lexicons });
  ```

  options: `binding` (D1 binding name, default `"DB"`), `lexicons` (see below), `onInit` (one-shot app-specific setup).

  **`/xrpc/<ns>.lexicons` endpoint + `contrail-lex pull-service`** lets consumer apps typegen against a deployed contrail over HTTP, no PDS or DNS required:

  - `contrail-lex generate` now emits a barrel `lexicons/generated/index.ts` that imports every lexicon the deployment speaks: generated + pulled + custom. The pulled lexicons are needed so consumer typegen can resolve `$ref`s out of the generated schemas.
  - Pass `{ lexicons }` to `createWorker` (or `createHandler(contrail, { lexicons })`) and the service exposes them at `GET /xrpc/<namespace>.lexicons`.
  - From a consumer app:
    ```bash
    contrail-lex pull-service https://my-contrail.dev/xrpc/com.example.lexicons
    # or
    contrail-lex pull-service https://my-contrail.dev --namespace com.example
    ```
    Fetches the manifest, writes each lexicon under `lexicons/pulled/`. Then `npx lex-cli generate` emits TS types.

  Path 1 of 4 of a set of DX improvements — path 2 (consumer typegen) works end-to-end but assumes the operator has regenerated. Paths 3 (one-command deploy) and 4 (fully vendored worker) are deferred.

- b81038c: add `refresh` — a "catch-up" CLI + method that reconciles every known DID's PDS against the DB and reports what was missed.

  unlike `backfillAll`, it ignores the `backfills` state table and sweeps fresh. useful after jetstream outages or after leaving a dev deployment idle for days.

  each record in each configured collection is classified as:

  - **missing** — PDS has it, DB doesn't
  - **stale update** — DB has it with a different CID, _and_ the DB row was written before the ignore window (default 60s, configurable)
  - **in sync** — same CID, or DB row is within the ignore window

  ```bash
  pnpm contrail refresh                   # totals
  pnpm contrail refresh --by-collection   # + per-nsid breakdown
  pnpm contrail refresh --ignore-window 30
  ```

  programmatic: `contrail.refresh({ ignoreWindowMs, concurrency })` returns per-collection stats + totals. also exported from `@atmo-dev/contrail/workers` as `refresh()` for wrangler-backed deployments.

  safe to run repeatedly — each pass converges toward zero. not a replacement for `ingest` / `runPersistent` (walks every user's history, which is expensive); use for after-outage reconciliation or dev-idle catch-up.

  also extends `ExistingRecordInfo` with an `indexed_at: number | null` field so callers using `lookupExistingRecords` can inspect per-row freshness without a second query.

### Patch Changes

- 3ee5ed4: tighten spaces ACL: owners no longer bypass the "own-record" rule on delete. everyone in the member list — owner included — can only delete records they authored.

  before: owner calling `space.deleteRecord` on someone else's record returned `200 { ok: true }` (ACL passed, but the adapter's SQL was already scoped to `did = caller`, so no rows were actually deleted — the response lied).

  after: that same call returns `403 { error: "Forbidden", reason: "not-own-record" }`. honest response; no behavior change at the storage layer.

  to wipe someone else's records in a space you own, delete the space itself.

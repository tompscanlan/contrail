## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b34d87: Add a first-class `sinks` config option: write-only, post-commit observers of applied records.

  A `Sink` builds derived state (a search index, an audit log, a webhook fan-out) from every record contrail ingests. Each configured sink's `onRecords(events, { phase })` fires inside `applyEvents()` after the DB commit, on **both** the live and backfill paths, receiving one deduplicated `RecordEvent` per record. Failures are isolated — a throwing sink is logged via the configured logger and never blocks ingestion.

  Unlike `realtime.pubsub`, a sink is not a subscriber: it serves no reads, requires no ticket secret, and must see backfilled records (where realtime is intentionally silent). Public records only — space-scoped records publish via the publishing adapter and never reach the fan-out.

  Purely additive: `realtime` and all existing behavior are unchanged. Runs identically on D1 and Postgres (it is an in-process call after commit, not a database-log consumer).

### Minor Changes

- 89aee1b: perf: gate schema replay on a fingerprint; add opt-in planner-stat maintenance

  Two independent performance fixes found while profiling a D1 consumer.

  **Cold-start schema replay (always on).** `initSchema` ran ~40 base/collection/
  index/fts/feed/spaces DDL statements serially on every `init()` call, with no
  gate. Consumers call `init()` once per isolate and Workers isolates recycle
  constantly, so the first request to each cold isolate paid ~40 sequential
  round-trips to the D1 storage object before any real work. `initSchema` now
  records a fingerprint of the resolved schema (hash of the generated DDL +
  `CONTRAIL_SCHEMA_VERSION`) in a new `_contrail_meta` table and, on a match,
  skips all DDL after a single read. Steady-state cold start drops from ~40
  round-trips to one; the full apply only runs on first init or an actual schema
  change. Concurrent-init safety on Postgres is unchanged (the gate just wraps the
  existing idempotent apply).

  **Query-planner statistics (opt-in).** Without `ANALYZE`, SQLite's planner picks
  the least-selective index for multi-predicate queries (measured ~50x more rows
  read on a `subject.uri` + `status` filter). New opt-in config:

  ```ts
  maintenance: {
    optimize: true;
  } // or { intervalMs, analysisLimit }
  ```

  When enabled, the ingest tick runs a CPU-bounded `PRAGMA analysis_limit=400;
PRAGMA optimize` on a persisted daily cadence (stored in `_contrail_meta`, so it
  isn't defeated by recycled isolates — the same in-memory-state bug the feed
  prune had). `analysis_limit` bounds the work so it can't exceed D1's per-query
  CPU budget and reset the DO. Also exposed as `contrail.optimize(db)` for
  consumers that prefer to schedule it themselves. No-op on Postgres
  (autovacuum/autoanalyze handles planner stats).

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 4c8fedb: fix(identity): stop stranding/clobbering handles during resolution (#42)

  Backfill left a meaningful fraction of identities with a PDS but no handle.
  Two root causes:

  - `resolvePDSCached` short-circuited on any row with a non-null PDS and returned
    without ever resolving the handle. A partial resolution (slingshot can return
    a PDS without a handle under load) was therefore persisted and never healed.
    It now treats a row as a complete cache hit only when both PDS _and_ handle are
    present; a PDS-only row falls through to re-resolve and fill the handle, while
    still serving the known PDS (including if the re-resolution fails).
  - `saveIdentity` overwrote `handle`/`pds` unconditionally, so
    `refreshStaleIdentities` (which passes a null handle through when slingshot
    omits one) could clobber a previously-resolved handle with null. The upsert now
    COALESCEs both columns: a fresh non-null value still applies (handle changes
    work), but a null never nulls a good value.

  Backfill also resolves PDS endpoints up front instead of in a detached
  background promise, so identity resolution no longer competes with record
  backfill for slingshot — reducing the partial responses that triggered the
  above in the first place.

### Minor Changes

- d7e0936: Private-network deployment support via a new optional `ContrailConfig.networkOverrides` block.

  `networkOverrides` carries three optional subfields, all defaulting to the current public-internet behavior (omit the block entirely and nothing changes):

  - **`resolver`** — a custom `DidDocumentResolver` used during DID-doc PDS fallback, labeler-endpoint resolution, and spaces service-auth JWT verification. Lets a deployment point at a private PLC mirror or inject a custom fetch (mTLS, retry, instrumentation). Trusted; not SSRF-checked.
  - **`slingshotUrl`** — override the slingshot identity-resolver endpoint. Trusted; not SSRF-checked.
  - **`additionalAllowedHosts`** — hostnames that bypass the default SSRF guard when validating a resolved PDS or labeler endpoint. Match is exact, case-insensitive, port-agnostic (e.g. `["pds.dev.svc.cluster.local"]`). This is the only knob that widens the validator; there is no "disable SSRF" flag.

  The overrides are threaded through PDS/identity resolution (`resolvePDS`, `getPDS`, `getClient`, `resolveIdentity*`, `refreshStaleIdentities`), labeler endpoint resolution and ingest (`resolveLabelerEndpoint`, `getLabelerState`, label subscribe cycles), and service-auth verification (`buildVerifier` in both the appview router and the community integration). The in-scope `config` is now also passed at every appview call site that resolves identities or PDS endpoints — the live-ingest refresh cycle (`runIngestCycle` → `refreshStaleIdentities`), the on-demand `refresh` path, and the router actor/identity/PDS resolution paths (`getProfile`, `getFeed`, collection queries, profile hydration, notify) — so private-network deploys honor the override on those paths instead of silently falling back to the public resolver and un-widened SSRF guard.

  The SSRF guard is now a single shared validator: `validateExternalUrl(url, additionalAllowedHosts?)` is exported from `contrail-base` and consumed by both the PDS client and labeler-endpoint resolution. `validateEndpointUrl` remains exported as a thin alias for backward compatibility. This removes the previous duplicate validator (`validatePdsUrl` + `validateEndpointUrl`) where an allowlist or SSRF-rule edit could be applied to only one copy.

  Also hardens schema initialization for concurrent/Postgres deployments: a dialect-aware `addColumnIfNotExists` (Postgres `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`; SQLite pre-check), narrow absorption of the Postgres concurrent-`CREATE` race (42P07 / 23505 on pg_type/pg_class/pg_namespace indexes), and per-statement (rather than batched) DDL during `initSchema` / `initSpacesSchema` / spaces schema. Genuine DDL errors (syntax, type mismatch, missing column/table) still propagate.

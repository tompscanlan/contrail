 *  Owns the host-side adapter (records, blobs, enrollment) + DDL + blob-GC.
 *  Independent of the authority — takes a Database directly, doesn't inherit
 *  from anything. Bundles can instantiate this alongside HostedAuthorityAdapter
 *  against the same DB to get full StorageAdapter behavior. */

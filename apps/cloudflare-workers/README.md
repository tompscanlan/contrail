# cloudflare-workers

Minimal runnable Contrail deployment: Cloudflare Workers, D1, and one public collection (`community.lexicon.calendar.event`). It mirrors the setup in the [root README](../../README.md).

## layout

```
src/contrail.config.ts   — shared config (collections, queryables, searchables)
src/worker.ts            — fetch handler + scheduled ingest
wrangler.jsonc           — d1 binding + cron
```

backfills run via the `contrail` CLI from the library (see `package.json` scripts) — no script file needed. The default source is selective PDS acquisition; `--alluvium` selects the experimental fresh-generation base/archive path.

## setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm wrangler d1 create contrail         # copy database_id into wrangler.jsonc
pnpm contrail backfill --remote          # discover + backfill historical events
pnpm deploy                              # deploy the worker
```

then hit:

```
GET https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/xrpc/com.example.event.listRecords?startsAtMin=2026-01-01&limit=10
GET https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/status
```

`/status` returns JSON with the live-ingest cursor, indexed record totals, discovery progress, per-collection progress, and mutually exclusive complete/pending/retrying/failed account counts.

## local dev

```bash
pnpm dev                # wraps wrangler dev + auto-fires cron + prompts for initial backfill
pnpm contrail backfill  # backfill against the local D1 created by wrangler
```

To test the experimental Alluvium path, start with a disposable empty local D1 and supply an operator-owned continuity epoch:

```bash
rm -rf .wrangler/state # destructive: local test data only
pnpm contrail backfill \
  --alluvium \
  --alluvium-epoch local-calendar-canary-2026-08 \
  --allow-partial
```

`--allow-partial` is currently necessary because the public calendar manifest reports known historical account omissions; without it the command deliberately fails closed. The command verifies and projects only the pinned base plus archive tail, then prints the archived cursor saved for normal ingestion. Exercise post-archive catch-up with the ordinary scheduled handler:

```bash
pnpm wrangler dev --test-scheduled
curl 'http://localhost:8787/__scheduled?cron=*%2F1+*+*+*+*'
curl http://localhost:8787/status
```

Repeated scheduled invocations resume from the saved cursor. The command rejects a database containing records or a live cursor unless it already has resumable bootstrap state; it must not reset an active generation. For a remote canary, point `wrangler.jsonc` at a new unpublished D1 database before adding `--remote`.

`pnpm dev` runs `contrail dev` under the hood. On start it inspects the local D1 and offers to start or resume backfill whenever known work remains, then runs `wrangler dev --test-scheduled` with a 60s timer hitting `/__scheduled` so the cron actually fires locally.

A failed PDS account stays incomplete rather than being marked complete. The initial command uses a bounded attempt budget, then records an exponential retry time. The normal one-minute Worker cron retries a small due slice after live ingestion, with delays from 15 minutes up to 48 hours and a ten-scheduled-attempt limit, so dead PDSes cannot monopolize the tick. Rerunning the command resets exhausted rows and forces an immediate bounded pass.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/status
```

This reports the durable state without exposing account DIDs or raw upstream errors. `state: "running"` means a manual or scheduled backfill slice currently owns the database lease. `state: "complete"` means discovery and the initial pass finished; account counts separately show work that is `pending`, `retrying`, or permanently `failed` until an explicit reset.

## extending

- **add a collection:** append to `collections` in `src/contrail.config.ts`; redeploy; `pnpm contrail backfill --remote` to backfill the new one.
- **add full-text search:** `searchable: ["field1", "field2"]`, redeploy, no backfill needed (fts indexes repopulate on ingest).
- **add relations / references:** see [configuration guide](../../docs/02-configure-and-query.md).

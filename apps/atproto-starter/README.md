# atproto-starter

> **For AI agents.** This README is the playbook for taking a fresh copy of this template and turning it into a deployed atproto app on Cloudflare. Follow it top-to-bottom. Stop and ask the user when a step says to.

A SvelteKit + Cloudflare Workers starter for atproto apps. Includes:

- OAuth login (`@atcute/oauth-node-client`, KV-backed sessions, signed cookies)
- Indexed XRPC endpoints over D1 via [contrail](https://github.com/flo-bit/contrail) + Jetstream
- Typed client for in-process queries
- `.mcp.json` wires up the [lexicon.garden MCP](https://lexicon.garden/help/mcp) — use its `validate_lexicon`, `describe_lexicon`, `create_record_cid`, `invoke_xrpc`, `facet_text` tools whenever authoring or debugging lexicons

**Reference docs:**
- [`./CONTRAIL.md`](./CONTRAIL.md) — opinionated short notes on how *this template* uses contrail (data fetching patterns, where to call from, types). Read this before writing any data-fetching code.
- Full contrail docs at <https://flo-bit.dev/contrail/llms-full.txt> — fetch this before Phase 5 if authoring lexicons, configuring queryables, or anything beyond the happy path.

## Phase 0 — Ask the user (do this once, all up front)

Ask **all** of these in a single batch before touching anything. The goal: gather everything once so you can run uninterrupted from Phase 1 to deploy. Don't stop mid-flow to ask follow-ups.

1. **Project name?** Used for package name, worker name, D1 database name, KV namespace names. Recommend lowercase-kebab, e.g. `mybookmarks`.
2. **Domain?** (e.g. `mybookmarks.app`)
   - If **yes**: use it for `OAUTH_PUBLIC_URL` and reverse it for the contrail namespace (`mybookmarks.app` → `app.mybookmarks`). **Also ask: is the zone already on Cloudflare?** (CF must be the DNS provider — if not, the user needs to add the zone at dash.cloudflare.com first; you can't.)
   - If **no**: ask for their **workers.dev subdomain** (visible at `dash.cloudflare.com → Workers & Pages → top right`, e.g. `john-doe.workers.dev`). The deploy URL will be `https://<project>.<subdomain>.workers.dev`. Use that as `OAUTH_PUBLIC_URL`. For namespace, fall back to `dev.<project>` and note they should switch to a real domain before going public. (`wrangler whoami` does **not** return the subdomain — you must ask.)
3. **Which collections does the app write/index?** One or more atproto NSIDs (e.g. `community.lexicon.calendar.event`, `app.bsky.feed.post`). For custom record types, you'll author a new lexicon in Phase 5. Use lexicon.garden's `describe_lexicon` MCP tool to inspect any NSIDs the user mentions.
4. **Open signup?** (default yes) Controls `ALLOW_SIGNUP` in `src/lib/atproto/settings.ts`. If yes, which PDS for signups? (default: `https://selfhosted.social/` for prod, `https://pds.rip/` for dev)
5. **`wrangler login` done?** You can't run it for them — it's interactive. If they haven't, ask them to run it now in another terminal before you start. You'll verify with `npx wrangler whoami` once you reach Phase 3.

Restate the answers back in one block before continuing so the user can correct anything.

**Then, before Phase 1, invoke the `impeccable` skill in `teach` mode:** `Skill(skill: 'impeccable', args: 'teach')`. This runs a short branding/design interview with the user and writes a design guidelines file the rest of the build references. Do not skip — later UI work depends on it. The branding questions are *separate* from the technical questions above, but happen in the same up-front block so the user isn't interrupted later.

From Phase 1 onward, no more questions unless something genuinely fails.

---

## Phase 1 — Local dev (zero Cloudflare)

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm env:setup-dev   # generates COOKIE_SECRET + CLIENT_ASSERTION_KEY into .env, randomizes DEV_PORT
pnpm dev
```

Dev mode uses a loopback OAuth client — no public URL, no Cloudflare resources, no secrets in CF. Verify in the browser that login works against a real PDS before continuing.

---

## Phase 2 — Apply the user's answers

Edit these files using the answers from Phase 0. Every placeholder from the original template lives here:

| File | What to change |
|---|---|
| `package.json` | `name` → `<project>` |
| `wrangler.jsonc` | `name` → `<project>`; `vars.OAUTH_PUBLIC_URL` → `https://<domain-or-workersdev>`; `d1_databases[0].database_name` → `<project>`; leave `database_id` as `REPLACE_WITH_D1_DATABASE_ID` (Phase 3 fills it). **If custom domain:** also add the `routes` block below. |
| `src/lib/contrail.config.ts` | `namespace` → reversed domain; `collections` → user's collections |
| `src/lib/atproto/settings.ts` | `collections` → user's writable NSIDs; `signUpPDS` (devPDS/prodPDS); `ALLOW_SIGNUP` |

**Custom domain — `wrangler.jsonc` `routes` block.** If the user has a domain (and the zone is on Cloudflare), append this at the top level of `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"routes": [
  { "pattern": "mybookmarks.app", "custom_domain": true }
],
"workers_dev": false
```

`custom_domain: true` makes wrangler set up DNS records and the SSL cert automatically on `wrangler deploy` — no dashboard clicks. `workers_dev: false` disables the `<name>.<subdomain>.workers.dev` URL so the worker is *only* reachable at the custom domain (recommended; otherwise OAuth metadata can drift between two URLs).

For subdomains, use the full hostname (e.g. `pattern: "app.mybookmarks.com"`). The zone (`mybookmarks.com`) still has to be on Cloudflare; the subdomain doesn't need to exist as a DNS record yet — wrangler creates it.

If the deploy in Phase 6 fails with a zone error, the user needs to add the domain to Cloudflare first (point registrar nameservers to CF). That's the one step you can't automate.

**Do not** edit `lex.config.js` — it's regenerated by `contrail-lex generate` from `contrail.config.ts` on every run, and is gitignored.

**Do not** keep statusphere references anywhere. After editing, grep for `statusphere`, `xyz.statusphere` — anything left is project residue.

After namespace/collection changes, regenerate types: `pnpm generate:pull` (this runs the full pipeline: regenerates `lex.config.js`, pulls NSIDs, emits types).

---

## Phase 3 — Cloudflare provisioning

Verify the user is logged in (they confirmed in Phase 0): `npx wrangler whoami`. If it fails, stop and tell the user to run `wrangler login`.

All resources are **project-scoped** so the user can run multiple apps from this template in the same CF account without collision. The bindings (`DB`, `OAUTH_SESSIONS`, `OAUTH_STATES`) stay constant since the code references those by name; only the resource `name`/`title` changes.

```sh
# D1
npx wrangler d1 create <project>
# → copy the returned database_id into wrangler.jsonc d1_databases[0].database_id

# KV (project-prefixed names so multiple projects don't collide)
npx wrangler kv namespace create <project>-OAUTH_SESSIONS
npx wrangler kv namespace create <project>-OAUTH_STATES
# → copy each returned id into wrangler.jsonc kv_namespaces[*].id
```

After this phase, `wrangler.jsonc` should have no `REPLACE_WITH_*` strings and no leftover ids from another project.

---

## Phase 4 — Secrets

Three secrets needed in production. **Never put these in `wrangler.jsonc` `vars`** — use `wrangler secret put`. Each script just prints to stdout, so pipe directly:

```sh
# 1. CLIENT_ASSERTION_KEY — OAuth client signing key (JWK JSON)
pnpm env:generate-key | npx wrangler secret put CLIENT_ASSERTION_KEY

# 2. COOKIE_SECRET — HMAC for signed session cookies
pnpm env:generate-secret | npx wrangler secret put COOKIE_SECRET

# 3. CRON_SECRET — bearer the scheduled handler uses to call /api/cron
pnpm env:generate-secret | npx wrangler secret put CRON_SECRET
```

`OAUTH_PUBLIC_URL` is a `var` (already set in Phase 2), not a secret — it's the public URL.

---

## Phase 5 — Lexicons (only if user wants custom record types)

If the user is only indexing existing NSIDs (e.g. `app.bsky.feed.post`), skip this phase — `pnpm generate:pull` already fetched them.

For a new lexicon under the user's namespace:

1. Use the lexicon.garden MCP `describe_lexicon` tool to look at neighbors with similar shape. Match conventions.
2. Author the JSON in `lexicons/custom/<nsid>.json`.
3. Validate with the MCP `validate_lexicon` tool before saving.
4. Add the collection to `src/lib/contrail.config.ts` (and `src/lib/atproto/settings.ts` if it's writable from the app).
5. `pnpm generate:pull` — regenerates `lex.config.js` from the contrail config, pulls referenced NSIDs, emits types into `src/lexicon-types/`.

---

## Phase 6 — Deploy + backfill

```sh
pnpm build
npx wrangler deploy
pnpm backfill:remote   # one-shot historical backfill from Jetstream
```

After deploy, the cron trigger (`*/1 * * * *` in `wrangler.jsonc`) keeps the index fresh.

Sanity check: hit `https://<deployed-url>/xrpc/<namespace>.<collection>.listRecords?limit=10` and confirm JSON comes back. Then load the site root and try logging in.

## Styling / UI

**Before composing any UI, invoke `Skill(skill: 'impeccable', args: 'craft')`.** This produces components shape-first using the design guidelines created by `impeccable teach` in Phase 0. It's what stops the output from defaulting to generic AI aesthetics. Run it once per significant UI surface (home page, settings page, feature flow) — not per component.

**Default to [foxui](https://flo-bit.dev/ui-kit/docs/llms.txt).** It's already a dependency (`@foxui/core`, `@foxui/social`, `@foxui/time`) and ships components specifically built for atproto apps — `AtprotoLoginModal`, `GithubCorner`, `RelativeTime`, profile/handle helpers, etc. Using foxui means the OAuth login flow, profile rendering, and social bits all "just work" without you reinventing them. Fetch the llms.txt above before composing UI.

If foxui's look doesn't fit the design guidelines from Phase 0, **build custom components but don't reinvent the structure.** First read the foxui source for the component you're replacing (e.g. how `AtprotoLoginModal` handles the handle-input → PDS-resolution → redirect flow). Re-create with your own styling, but keep the data flow and prop shapes the same — atproto OAuth has subtle requirements (loopback vs. confidential client, redirect URIs, scope handling) that foxui already gets right.

Tailwind v4 is set up, so utility classes work out of the box. The `bits-ui` primitives (also already a dependency) are a good base for accessible, headless components if you're going custom.

**After building, optional finishing skills** — invoke when the work calls for them, not as a checklist:

- `Skill(skill: 'polish')` — final pass for alignment, spacing, micro-detail consistency.
- `Skill(skill: 'audit')` — a11y, performance, theming, anti-patterns; produces a scored report.
- `Skill(skill: 'animate')` — purposeful motion / micro-interactions if the design calls for it.
- `Skill(skill: 'clarify')` — improve UX copy, error messages, labels.
- `Skill(skill: 'impeccable', args: 'extract')` — once you have a few components, pull reusable patterns + tokens into a design system.

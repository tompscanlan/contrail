Private-network deployment support via a new optional `ContrailConfig.networkOverrides` block.

`networkOverrides` carries three optional subfields, all defaulting to the current public-internet behavior (omit the block entirely and nothing changes):

- **`resolver`** — a custom `DidDocumentResolver` used during DID-doc PDS fallback, labeler-endpoint resolution, and spaces service-auth JWT verification. Lets a deployment point at a private PLC mirror or inject a custom fetch (mTLS, retry, instrumentation). Trusted; not SSRF-checked.
- **`slingshotUrl`** — override the slingshot identity-resolver endpoint. Trusted; not SSRF-checked.
- **`additionalAllowedHosts`** — hostnames that bypass the default SSRF guard when validating a resolved PDS or labeler endpoint. Match is exact, case-insensitive, port-agnostic (e.g. `["pds.dev.svc.cluster.local"]`). This is the only knob that widens the validator; there is no "disable SSRF" flag.

The overrides are threaded through PDS/identity resolution (`resolvePDS`, `getPDS`, `getClient`, `resolveIdentity*`, `refreshStaleIdentities`), labeler endpoint resolution and ingest (`resolveLabelerEndpoint`, `getLabelerState`, label subscribe cycles), and service-auth verification (`buildVerifier` in both the appview router and the community integration). `validateEndpointUrl` / `validatePdsUrl` now accept an allowlist argument.

Also hardens schema initialization for concurrent/Postgres deployments: a dialect-aware `addColumnIfNotExists` (Postgres `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`; SQLite pre-check), narrow absorption of the Postgres concurrent-`CREATE` race (42P07 / 23505 on pg_type/pg_class/pg_namespace indexes), and per-statement (rather than batched) DDL during `initSchema` / `initSpacesSchema` / spaces schema. Genuine DDL errors (syntax, type mismatch, missing column/table) still propagate.

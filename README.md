# Contrail

> **Pre-alpha.** Expect breaking changes.

Contrail turns AT Protocol records into a queryable AppView. The published package targets public records; an optional workspace-private alpha extension adds permissioned Space projections.

It provides:

- historical backfill from relays and PDSes;
- current updates from Jetstream;
- D1, SQLite, and PostgreSQL storage;
- `getRecord` and `listRecords` HTTP endpoints;
- filters, sorting, search, and pagination;
- custom queries;
- relationship counts and hydration; and
- profile and label hydration.

Cloudflare Workers with D1 is the primary deployment target. Node.js with SQLite or PostgreSQL is also supported.

## Quick start from a Lexicon prefix

```bash
pnpx @atmo-dev/contrail init my-appview \
  --prefix community.lexicon.calendar. \
  --namespace com.example.calendar
cd my-appview
pnpx @atmo-dev/contrail dev
```

`--prefix` selects the source record Lexicons to import; `--namespace` sets the
separate XRPC namespace for the generated AppView methods. See the
[prefix setup guide](docs/01-getting-started.md#initialize-from-your-lexicon-prefix)
for choosing a prefix, generated files, and import options.

## Repository layout

There is one published package and one optional unpublished alpha extension:

```text
packages/contrail/                @atmo-dev/contrail
packages/contrail-spaces-alpha/   @atmo-dev/contrail-spaces-alpha (private)
```

The Spaces extension is an aggregator/AppView, not an authority or record host. The previous custom authority, record-host, community, and realtime products remain removed.

See [development.md](development.md) for repository commands.

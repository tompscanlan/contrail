# Communities

Group-controlled atproto DIDs. A community is a DID whose signing/rotation keys are held by the appview on behalf of multiple members, with tiered access levels. Built on top of [spaces](./03-spaces.md).

## When to use this

When you want atproto records published under a *shared* identity — a team, a project, a channel — not a single user. Think: a group's published calendar events, a community's published posts.

## Two modes

- **Minted** — contrail creates a fresh `did:plc` for the community, holds the signing + rotation keys, publishes from it.
- **Adopted** — contrail takes over an existing DID whose rotation keys were handed over by the owner.

Either way, the result is the same: a DID that multiple members can act through, gated by access levels.

## Access levels

Each member has a level (ranked). Levels map to write permissions. Owners can grant/revoke levels. Two reserved levels exist: `owner` and `member`. Your deployment defines the rest:

```ts
community: {
  masterKey: ENV.COMMUNITY_MASTER_KEY,  // 32-byte encryption key for stored credentials
  serviceDid: "did:web:example.com",
  levels: ["admin", "moderator"],        // ranked, highest-first
}
```

Stored credentials (app passwords for adopted communities, signing keys for minted) are envelope-encrypted with `masterKey`. Never ship the placeholder.

## How it composes with spaces

A community *owns* spaces. Members of the community get access to community-owned spaces based on their level. Grant access per-space per-level:

```
community.space.grant  { spaceUri, level: "admin", perms: "write" }
```

The spaces layer stays ignorant of access levels — it just sees "this DID is a member with these perms." The community layer projects member × level → space perms.

## XRPCs

- `com.example.community.mint | adopt | list | delete`
- `com.example.community.invite.create | redeem | revoke | list`
- `com.example.community.setAccessLevel | revoke | listMembers`
- `com.example.community.space.create | grant | revoke | ...` — community-owned spaces
- `com.example.community.putRecord | deleteRecord` — publish records as the community DID

## What's not here

- No per-record per-level ACLs. Model as spaces.
- No auto-rotation on key compromise yet.
- Adoption is irreversible without manual key surrender back to the owner.

The design follows zicklag's [Arbiter design sketch](https://zicklag.leaflet.pub/3mjrvb5pul224) for group management on atproto. The post is an early design note; our implementation will track it as the spec firms up.
